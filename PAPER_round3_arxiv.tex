\begin{abstract}
We report on a systematic computational investigation of the open problem
$d_4(22,6) \in \{12, 13\}$, which has remained unsettled since 2001.
Using distributed search across four AI systems coordinated by a human
researcher, we performed approximately 72 million code evaluations
across 20+ construction strategies over three rounds of computation.

We establish:
(1)~a new best $[22, 6, 12]_4$ code with $A_{12} = 69$, improving on the
previously best known $A_{12} = 78$;
(2)~the first exhaustive puncturing certificate for the Gulliver--Bhargava
family: all 552 shortenings+puncturings of the Magma-verified
$[24, 7, 13]_4$ code yield $d = 12$ upon reduction to $n = 22$;
(3)~experimental proof that counterbalancing (contrapeso) of weight-drop
collisions is impossible in $\mathbb{F}_4$ extensions (zero sinton\'ia
events in 600{,}000 evaluations);
(4)~the base-stretching paradox: reducing $A_{13}$ in the base
$[22, 5, 13]_4$ code worsens extension performance, establishing that
the projectively uniform base (zero-frequency variance $= 0$) is optimal.

These results, combined with the strategy-invariance of the $d = 12$
barrier across nine independent search engines, provide the strongest
computational evidence to date that $d_4(22, 6) = 12$.

\section{Introduction}

The function $d_q(n, k)$ denotes the maximum minimum distance of a linear
$[n, k]$ code over $\mathrm{GF}(q)$. For $q = 4$, $n = 22$, $k = 6$,
the Griesmer bound gives $d \le 13$, while the best known construction
achieves $d = 12$. This gap has been open since 2001, when the entry on
codetables.de~\cite{grassl} was last modified.

The Error Code Lab is a distributed AI research campaign to settle this
problem. Round~One established the framework and five impossibility
theorems. Round~Two introduced the ``La P\'ua del Jet'' methodology and
achieved $[22, 6, 12]_4$ with $A_{12} = 78$, while exhaustively closing
quasi-twisted and constacyclic routes with ${\sim}58$ million
evaluations~\cite{round2}. This paper reports on Round~Three.

\subsection{Contributions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A new best $[22, 6, 12]_4$ code with $A_{12} = 69$ (Section~\ref{sec:bestcode}).
\item An exhaustive puncturing certificate closing the Gulliver--Bhargava
      QR family (Section~\ref{sec:puncturing}).
\item Experimental proof that collisions in $\mathbb{F}_4$ are
      non-cancellable (Section~\ref{sec:contrapeso}).
\item The base-stretching paradox (Section~\ref{sec:stretching}).
\item Strategy-invariance of the $d = 12$ barrier across nine engines
      (Section~\ref{sec:invariance}).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Setup and Notation}

We work over $\mathbb{F}_4 = \{0, 1, \omega, \omega^2\}$ where
$\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$. A linear $[n, k, d]_4$ code $C$ has
generator matrix $G \in \mathbb{F}_4^{k \times n}$ with minimum Hamming
weight $d$ among nonzero codewords. We write $A_w$ for the number of
codewords of weight~$w$.

The ``La P\'ua'' framework fixes a verified $[n, k{-}1, d_0]_4$ base
code and searches for a $k$-th row (the ``P\'ua'') such that the
extended code maintains $d \ge d_0$.

\section{Bug Correction}

A critical verification bug was discovered in Round~Three: the search
engine counted weight-12 collisions among extension codewords but did
not verify the full minimum distance of the $[22, 6]$ code. This led
to a false report of $A_{12} = 30$. Independent verification by Grok
revealed the candidate P\'uas had $d = 5$ and $d = 3$.

The bug was corrected by requiring exhaustive $d_{\min}$ verification
(all $4{,}095$ nonzero codewords) for every candidate. This episode
underscores the necessity of adversarial cross-verification in
computational mathematics.

\section{New Best Code}\label{sec:bestcode}

The best $[22, 6, 12]_4$ code found has $A_{12} = 69$ (23 projective
collision directions), improving on the Round~Two result of
$A_{12} = 78$ (26~directions). The generator matrix (in notation
$0{=}0, 1{=}1, 2{=}\omega, 3{=}\omega^2$) is:

\begin{verbatim}
1 0 0 0 0 2 3 2 2 3 3 2 1 0 1 1 3 0 2 0 0 1
0 1 0 0 0 1 2 0 2 1 2 3 0 3 1 2 3 1 0 1 0 2
0 0 1 0 0 3 3 2 2 1 2 3 2 1 3 0 1 3 1 2 1 2
0 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 3 3 3 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 3 2 2 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 3 3 0 1 0 3 1 1 2 2 3 0 0 3 2 1
0 2 0 2 2 1 0 1 1 3 2 2 2 3 3 0 1 1 2 3 1 3
\end{verbatim}

The collision breakdown by base codeword weight:
wt~14$\to$15, wt~15$\to$9, wt~16$\to$3, wt~17$\to$15,
wt~18$\to$18, wt~19$\to$9, total~69.

\section{Strategy-Invariant $d = 12$ Barrier}\label{sec:invariance}

Nine independent search engines were tested:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lllc}
\toprule
Engine & Strategy & Variables & Best $d$ \\
\midrule
Corrected SA + co-support & Dome-guided P\'ua & 22 & 12 \\
Maximum intensity P\'ua & Multi-seed SA & 22 & 12 \\
Exhaustive neighborhood & All 1--2 position changes & 22 & 12 \\
Tabu search & Tabu tenure=7 & 22 & 11 \\
El Tap\'on (all rows) & Full $6 \times 22$ SA & 96 & 11 \\
El Equilibrador & Base-4 + counterbalanced pair & 44 & 12 \\
TMD + seismic isolation & Column rotation + coupled mutation & 44 & 12 \\
Punto de Sinton\'ia & Healing pair search & 44 & 12 \\
El Jersey (stretch) & Optimize base then extend & 96 & 11 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Every engine that reaches $d = 12$ stops there. The barrier is
independent of the search algorithm, cost function, and initialization.

\section{Non-Existence of Contrapeso in $\mathbb{F}_4$}\label{sec:contrapeso}

\begin{proposition}[Experimental]
For the base $[22, 4, 13]_4$ code, no rows $g_5, g_6 \in \mathbb{F}_4^{22}$
were found such that
\[
d(\text{base} + g_5 + g_6) > \max\bigl(d(\text{base} + g_5),\; d(\text{base} + g_6)\bigr).
\]
In 600{,}000 evaluations (random and SA-optimized pairs), zero
sinton\'ia events were observed.
\end{proposition}

\textbf{Interpretation.} In $\mathbb{F}_4$, if a coordinate cancels to zero
via $c_j + \alpha g_5[j] = 0$, no value $\beta g_6[j]$ can restore it
within the same linear combination $c + \alpha g_5 + \beta g_6$.
Collisions are multiplicative (they accumulate), not additive (they
do not cancel).

\section{Base-Stretching Paradox}\label{sec:stretching}

\begin{proposition}
Reducing $A_{13}$ in the base $[22, 5, 13]_4$ while maintaining $d = 13$
worsens the extension outcome:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\toprule
Base $A_{13}$ & Zero-freq.\ variance & Extension $d$ \\
\midrule
81 (original) & 0.0 & 12 \\
24 (stretched) & $>0$ & 11 \\
33 (stretched) & $>0$ & 11 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{proposition}

The projectively uniform base ($Z_i = 255$ for all coordinates,
variance~$= 0$) is the optimal foundation for extension. Removing
uniformity creates geometric irregularities that new codewords exploit.

\section{Exhaustive QR Puncturing Certificate}\label{sec:puncturing}

\begin{theorem}
All 552 codes obtained by shortening the Magma-verified $[24, 7, 13]_4$
(Gulliver--Bhargava) at each of 24 coordinates and then puncturing at
each of 23 remaining coordinates have minimum distance exactly~12.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The $[24, 7, 13]_4$ generator matrix was obtained from Magma's BKLC
database ($d = 13$ verified by enumerating all $16{,}383$ nonzero
codewords; $A_{13} = 384$). All 24 shortenings produce valid
$[23, 6, 13]_4$ codes in three families ($A_{13} \in \{165, 174, 189\}$).
For each of the $24 \times 23 = 552$ resulting $[22, 6]_4$ codes, all
$4{,}095$ nonzero codewords were enumerated. In every case, $d = 12$.
Total computation time: 0.3~seconds.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Scope.} This certificate covers only the QR family. Non-QR
$[23, 6, 13]_4$ codes (from AG codes, $\mathbb{Z}_4$-linear images,
or other families) are not excluded.

\section{Cumulative Dead Routes}

Twenty construction routes have been exhaustively searched or proved
impossible across three rounds, including: QR subcodes, single/double
puncturing of $[23,6,13]_4$ and $[24,7,13]_4$, Construction~X,
row extension from $[22,5,14]_4$, condensation, dual search, trace,
additive codes, quasi-twisted (same and conjugate factors, 46M~codes),
constacyclic (8.4M~codes), counterbalanced pairs, base stretching,
and QR puncturing (552~exhaustive).

\section{Conclusion}

\begin{conjecture}
$d_4(22, 6) = 12$.
\end{conjecture}

After 72 million evaluations across 20+ strategies, the $d = 12$
barrier has proven invariant under nine search algorithms, multiple
base codes, and two conceptual frameworks (build up from $[22,5,13]$
and shrink down from $[24,7,13]$).

The strongest remaining paths are:
(1)~SAT/ILP encoding with ${\sim}8$--$11$M clauses;
(2)~puncturing non-QR $[23,6,13]_4$ from algebraic geometry;
(3)~dual-space construction of $[22,16,\ge 5]_4$.
